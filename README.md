# Video Game Tracker

- A simple tracker that allows me or anyone to view games they'd like to play in the near future
- It also includes the details of the game like the year it released, the system it is avaiable to be played on, and the price of the game.
- If the user is logged in using Google OAuth they can add games to the list, update/edit the game details and also leave a review or remove what they think of the game
